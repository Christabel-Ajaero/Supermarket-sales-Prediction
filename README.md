# Supermarket-sales-Prediction
A data analysis work with prediction on the dataset of a supermarket sales carried out by my fellow team members and I during the Nigerian-German Center(Implemented by GIZ) sponsored boot-camp on Data science and Artificial Intelligence training. The Dataset was gotten from (kaggle.com). The problem statement was pointed out to be  constant expiration of a supermarket's product caused by overstocking which frequently led to much losses. Hence, this led to the aim of this project which is to predict the quantity of goods to be purchased in each day of the first quarter of subsequent years. This is achieved by using the model that best yields approximately the same Quantities as in the Sales record/Dataset for each transaction in the first quarter of 2019.  The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are getting high hence the need for precision on the quantity of the individual product line to be stocked in First quarter of any year to avoid overstocking, expiration of goods and boost profit.
From our analysis, Random Forest Regressor Model gave the most accurate result of all the other Models.
